<h1>WARNING!</h1>
<p>Stewie Griffin is a very dangerous individual.
    On the show, Stewie engages in extreme violent or criminal acts, including robbery, carjacking, loan sharking, forgery, and killing off many minor characters.
    The characters he kills off are for reasons such as anger, jealousy, and grudges he holds.
    Stewie's mastery of physics, mechanical engineering, and firearms are at a level of science fiction.
    He has constructed advanced fighter-jets, a mind control device, a weather control device, robots, a time machine, a shrinking pod, a teleportation device, and more.
    Stewie employs these to deal with the stresses of infant life such as teething pain, and his hatred of broccoli or to kill his mother.
    Stewie also shows infant-like tendencies such as pretending his trike is an actual vehicle.
    Stewie's ability to move objects of greater weight than himself is not surprising to other characters, nor is his ability to perform martial arts or retrieve firearms from hammerspace.</p>
